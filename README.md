## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- [ ] Allowing a feature to look at your post history
- [ ] Changing the post for them to be in chronological order
- [ ] Turn off likes on old post without having to go to settings

We have all used some type of social media. Most people find it absurd that we 
cannot see all the post in chronological order. We should also be able to see all 
the previous post we have looked at since sometimes we want to see a post, but 
leave the app and when we come back it has refreshed. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
